# Concepts

The Concepts section helps you learn about the parts of the CNOE components and helps you obtain a deeper understanding of how CNOE works.

**[What is CNOE (Cloud Native Operational Excellence)?](./intro/cnoe)**

An initiative to help large enterprises navigate the complex cloud-native tooling landscape, make informed technology choices, and collaborate on building a robust operational platform.


**[idpBuilder](./intro/idpbuilder)** 

A tool that simplifies the setup of a reference internal developer platform (IDP) by leveraging Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and other industry-standard technologies.

**[Technology Capabilities](./capabilities)** 

CNOE defines a comprehensive set of core capabilities required for building a cloud-native operational platform, covering areas like deployment, application packaging, continuous delivery, identity management, and more.

**[Technology Choices](./intro/technology)** 

CNOE aims to provide reference implementations and best practices for building Internal Developer Platform (idp) by documenting common patterns, tools, and configurations used in production environments. While organizations have different idp requirements, CNOE focuses on collecting community-driven implementations across key [capabilities](./capabilities) using established technologies rather than attempting to create a one-size-fits-all solution.

**[Technology Radars](./intro/radar)**

CNOE maintains visual radars to help the community align on technology choices and identify collaboration opportunities.
